              <p><b>Why did I pick this goal?</b> Throughout college, I felt like I was always rushing to get assigments done. Everyday, something new is happening, and many times I was just trying to survive the day. 
              I felt like the education that I dreamt to have, was slipping through my fingers. I was passing my classes, but the information was soon forgotten.
              The reason why I picked to do my assigments earlier is to focus on my motivation for being in college, instead of relying on the anxiety of that the soon deadline brought on me.

        
              </p>
              <p><b>How does it connect to my books?</b> Days are compost by 24 hours, which 8 should be spent sleeping (although college students seem to think 4 is enough) and at least 1 to 2 hours for human necesities like eating.
                That leaves us with 14 hours every day, yet most of us feels like there just isn't enough time. We let technology control our time, which ends up interuption our learning. I want to take control back in my education and work on my own timeline. I hope that I can use intrinsic motivation to get my work done.

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p><b>Why did I pick this goal?</b> I tend to always cram my studies to last minute, and trying to learn a whole semester the night before is impossible. By starting out earlier, I can have more time to actually learn the material and hopefully as a result get better grades.

                <p><b>How does it connect to my books?</b> The second book I read talks about productivity with ADHD, and this goals will allow me to explore the different techniques taught in the book and in the classroom.</p>
