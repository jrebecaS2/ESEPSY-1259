      <h3><b>Book #1: 'Boredom and Brilliant' by Manoush Zomorodi</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>What is the book about? This book is a challenge made by a journalist with the goal of reducing people’s phone usage and reconnecting with the art of boredom. We live in a society where being bored is bad, and can quickly be fixed by a little screen in our pockets. By learning how to allow ourselves to be uncomfortable in the silence or in tasks that are boring, we regain our brain’s ability to be brilliant. 

      </p>
      <p>Why did I pick this book? One of the areas of my life that I have been struggling with the most is screentime. My phone had been a constant in my life throughout the uncertainties and changes, and it is a core belief of mine that I need it, even though I don’t. The main issue is that my phone usage has affected my social and academic life, and I picked this book to gain some power back.

      </p>
      <p>How does it connect to my goals? This book connects to my goals of doing homework earlier and studying every day by helping me become more mindful of how I use my time and attention. If I can reduce distractions—especially digital ones—I’ll have more mental space to focus on studying consistently and getting started on assignments earlier. It’s also pushing me to be more intentional about how I spend my time, which is key to building better habits.</p>

      <h3><b>Book #2: 'Succeeding with Adult ADHD' by Abigail L. Levrini</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>What is the book about? This book is a guide designed to help adults with ADHD build skills to improve organization, time management, goal-setting, and self-regulation. The book blends cognitive-behavioral techniques with real-life strategies to help readers not just cope with ADHD, but thrive in their personal and professional lives.
      </p>
      <p>Why did I pick this book? I chose this book because I’ve been struggling with focus, productivity, and follow-through—especially with school and personal projects. I suspected that ADHD might be playing a role in how overwhelmed and unmotivated I sometimes feel, and I wanted to explore strategies that could help me feel more in control of my time and energy.

      </p>
      <p>How does it connect to my goals? This book connects to my goals of doing my homework earlier and studying every day by offering practical strategies to manage time, reduce procrastination, and stay focused. It gives step-by-step tools for building better routines and breaking tasks into manageable steps, which is exactly what I need to stay consistent with studying and avoid last-minute stress. By learning how to work with my brain instead of against it, I can build habits that support my academic success.</p>
