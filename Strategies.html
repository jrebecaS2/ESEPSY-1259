            </div>
        
            <div class="w3-container">
              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b>I often forget assigments due, so I thought this strategy would be useful. I bought a dry eraser board and wrote all my assigments a day before they were due. </p>
                <p><b>How did they work for you?</b> I liked the aspect of seeing all the assigments I have within a month. The main reason I don't think it worked for me,  it is a dry easer board that is on my apartment, and I usually don't do assigments on my room. I did not see he board that often.  
                </p> 
                <p><b>If you encountered any obstacles or challenges, how did you address them?</b> The obstacle that I encountered was the location of the board, but I took a picture on my phone to reference back. I think it would be helpful if instead I did a digital calendar and put it as my background on my iPad.

              <h3><b>Strategy #3: Delete that App from Book #1</b></h3>
            </div>
        
            <div class="w3-container">
              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b>I usually use my phone a lot, specially social media, so I decided to delete that app to give me more time in the day for other things.</p>
              <p><b>How did they work for you?</b> This was very challenging for me, and I did failed many times by redownloading the app multiple times after deleting it. I find it dificult because I am very unaware when I download it and I even started going on my iPad for instagram. 
                I do think that the days that I could stay off social media, I was able to get more work done. It is extremly helpful for me to not have distractions while I study, and this strategy is definitly one that I need to keep in mind for future semesters.  
              </p> 
              <p><b>If you encountered any obstacles or challenges, how did you address them?</b> My main issue was that I kept redownloading instagram, and it was really hard to stick with it. I find it that having someone keeping me accountable for it is helpful.

            </div>
        
            <div class="w3-container">
              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b> I get overwheled very easily, which causes me to procrastinate. I find that seeing all the steps that I need to do to accomplish something makes it less overwhelming. I used this to plan out my studying seassions.</p>
                <p><b>How did they work for you? If you encountered any obstacles or challenges, how did you address them?</b> In some ways, I have used this strategy before for studying, but I struggle with following through with the plan. It felt like I had the steps but I didn't know where to begin and the number of steps felt like it was a lot.
                  I found it helpful to block time to do work, which includes studying. I am learning to be more aware of my focus, and switching to other tasks if I can't focus for too long, to later go back.

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b>It is helpful to know what I need to get done in a day. I usually just use the breakdown steps of the activities I need to do and put it on my planner.</p>
              <p><b>How did they work for you?</b> I love using planners to write every day my to-do list, but I often forget about it. I think it would be helpful for me to have a morning rountine to include a time in the day to plan what I will get done.
