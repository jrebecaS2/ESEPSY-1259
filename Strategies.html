              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b></p>
                <p><b>How did they work for you?</b> I liked the aspect of seeing all the assigments I have within a month. The main reason I don't think it worked for me,  it is a dry easer board that is on my apartment, and I usually don't do assigments on my room. I did not see he board that often.  
                </p> 
                <p><b>If you encountered any obstacles or challenges, how did you address them?</b> The obstacle that I encountered was the location of the board, but I took a picture on my phone to reference back. I think it would be helpful if instead I did a digital calendar and put it as my background on my iPad.

              <p><b>Why did you pick this strategy and how did you implemented it?</b></p>
              <p><b>How did they work for you?</b> This was very challenging for me, and I did failed many times by redownloading the app multiple times after deleting it. I find it dificult because I am very unaware when I download it and I even started going on my iPad for instagram. 
                I do think that the days that I could stay off social media, I was able to get more work done. It is extremly helpful for me to not have distractions while I study, and this strategy is definitly one that I need to keep in mind for future semesters.
