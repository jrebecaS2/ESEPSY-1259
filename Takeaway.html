            <p><b>What were your three major takeaways from this project (What are the lessons you
              learned? What insights will continue to be important for you?)</b> For a long time, I believe that I was not capable of change. Throughout the years, I have tried many different techniques that in the end failed. Through the many failures, I learned that it takes time and effort to change a system that was in placed for many years. I started to celebrate the small wins instead of just giving up on the new skill I am learning. At first, doing a homework a day before was overwhelming, until I did a couple of them towards the end of the 2 weeks. 
               I am proud that, although I didn't finish many assigments 24 hours before, they were still submitted a couple of hours before and I was able to ask for help. For example, for my CSE2431 class, I had a homework that I finished the day before, but I was able to go to office hours to check my work. There was one lab that I started 3 days earlier for that same class, and I was able to ask for an extension since I had other assigments due and with the extra time I could also go to friends for help.
      The secound takeaway is that having a breakdown of the steps can help me feel less anxious, and feel more accomplished when I complete each of the steps. I learned that stress and anxiety are not bad thing, since I used to not do work to avoid feeling anything, but with this project I had to learn how to balance my emotions. 
    The final takeaway, it is how fortunate I am to be able to be stress over work I love doing. I felt so accomplished after seeing my grades getting higher as the semester went along and I tried new strategies. Negative emotions are just signals that our bodies/brain creates to allert us, but listening to know and learning about how to manage such emotions can be gratifying.        
    </p>
            <p><b>What progress did you make toward your goal(s)? (Did you meet it/them?)</b> I didn't meet them everyday, but by trying to achieve my goal, I have submitted all my assigments. The last 2 semesters, I did not submit most of the assigments I had for my classes, resulting into 2 failed classes, and I feel very accomplished having them all done by the deadline.    

            </p>
            <p><b>What are the most essential pieces of advice you want to share with others?</b>  Being consistent with the tasks you set to achieve your goals is key. Most of the goals we have are long term goals that take in every day effort to achieve, and breaking them down into smaller steps and planing how your time is spent is a way to know where your effort needs to go to.
              We all have a reason why we do things, but sometimes motivation is not enough, and in those days having a list of tasks you have to do can help, especially while battling with depression. 

            </p>
            <p><b>MY GRADES:</b> They are not all As, but I am proud of where they are now. I am also more hopeful for finals. Thank you Io for all the help and support you gave me and all of us through this semester!</p>
